# OthelloMVC
This was a group project to program the Othello board game in an MVC framework.
By Jeremiah Short, Jacob Showman, and Yonghao Wang using code written by Mr. Jaffe.
It currently works but has no AI player or move highlights.
The only known issue is that sometimes it fails to update whose turn it is. The issue is not reliably repeatable.
